# Algorithms-and-Data-Structures
A bunch of data structures, famous algorithms and assignments implemented by me (Assignments are from the Princeton Coursera Algorithms and Data Structures Course, which I've already done, but now I am implementing everything taught)

##Algorithms and Data Structures, Nov. 2020 (In Progress)
Implemented various data structures and algorithms (such as djikstra's two stack algorithm) presented at Princeton’s Coursera Course. Additionally, I’ve completed assignements that contemplate, among other things, modeling a percolation system of materials (Java)
